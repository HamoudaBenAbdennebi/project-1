            <h1>Tactile virtual reality</h1>
            <p>
              Researchers from Northwestern University have developed a
              prototype device which aims to put touch within VR’s reach, using
              a flexible material fitted with tiny vibrating components that can
              be attached to skin. The system, known as epidermal VR, could be
              useful in other cases as well, from a child touching a display
              relaying the gesture to a family member located elsewhere, to
              helping people with amputations renew their sense of touch. In
              gaming, it could alert players when a strike occurs on the
              corresponding body part of the game character.

            <p>
              Cut off a flatworm’s head, and it’ll grow a new one. Cut it in
              half, and you’ll have two new worms. Fire some radiation at it,
              and it’ll repair itself. Scientists have wanted to work out the
              mechanisms involved for some time, but the secret has eluded them.
              Enter an AI coded at Tufts University, Massachusetts. By analysing
              and simulating countless scenarios, the computer was able to solve
              the mystery of the flatworm’s regeneration in just 42 hours. In
              the end it produced a comprehensive model of how the flatworm’s
              genes allow it to regenerate. Although humans still need to feed
              the AI with information, the machine in this experiment was able
              to create a new, abstract theory independently – a huge step
              towards the development of a conscious computer, and potentially a
              landmark step in the way we carry out research.

            <p>
              If you want to take a trip into space, your quickest bet might be
              to take a balloon. The company World View Enterprises wants to
              send tourists into the stratosphere, 32km above Earth, on hot air
              balloons. Technically ‘space’ is defined as 100km above sea level,
              but 32km is high enough to witness the curvature of the Earth,
              just as Felix Baumgartner did on his space jump. The balloon flew
              its first successful test flight in June, and the company will
              start selling tickets in 2016 – at the bargain price of just
              £75,000 per person!

            <h1>Cancer-detecting ‘smart needles’</h1>
            <p>
              A “smart needle” has been developed by scientists in the UK which
              could speed up cancer detection and diagnosis times. Researchers
              believe the technology could be particularly helpful in diagnosing
              lymphoma, reducing patient anxiety as they await their results. At
              present, people with suspected lymphoma often have to provide a
              sample of cells, followed by a biopsy of the node to be carried
              out for a full diagnosis, a process which can be time consuming.
              The new device uses a technique known as Raman spectroscopy to
              shine a low-power laser into the part of the body being inspected,
              with the potential to spot concerns within seconds, scientists
              from the University of Exeter say. “The Raman smart needle can
              measure the molecular changes associated with disease in tissues
              and cells at the end of the needle,” said professor Nick Stone,
              project lead, from the University of Exeter. “Provided we can
              reach a lump or bump of interest with the needle tip, we should be
              able to assess if it is healthy or not.”

            <h1>Smart food labels</h1>
            <p>
              UK homes throw away 30 to 50 per cent of what we buy from
              supermarkets, says a 2013 report by the Institution of Mechanical
              Engineers. The report claimed we’re guided by ‘use by’ and ‘best
              before’ dates on food packaging, which are kept conservative
              because they are driven by shops’ desire to avoid legal action. An
              invention called ‘Bump Mark’ could change all that. Originally
              developed for blind people, it’s a label that starts out smooth to
              the touch but gets bumpier as food decays. And since it decays at
              the same rate as any protein-based food within, it’s far more
              accurate than printed dates.

            <h1>Internet for everyone</h1>
            <p>
              We can’t seem to live without the internet (how else would you
              read sciencefocus.com?), but still only around half the world’s
              population is connected. There are many reasons for this,
              including economic and social reasons, but for some the internet
              just isn’t accessible because they have no connection. Google is
              slowly trying to solve the problem using helium balloons to beam
              the internet to inaccessible areas, while Facebook has abandoned
              plans to do the same using drones, which means companies like
              Hiber are stealing a march. They have taken a different approach
              by launching their own network of shoebox-sized microsatellites
              into low Earth orbit, which wake up a modem plugged into your
              computer or device when it flies over and delivers your data.
              Their satellites orbit the Earth 16 times a day and are already
              being used by organisations like The British Antarctic Survey to
              provide internet access to very extreme of our planet.
