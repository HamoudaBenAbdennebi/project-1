            <h1>Autonomous robot</h1>
            <p>
              An autonomous robot, also known as simply an autorobot or autobot,
              is a robot that performs behaviors or tasks with a high degree of
              autonomy (without external influence). Autonomous robotics is
              usually considered to be a subfield of artificial intelligence,
              robotics, and information engineering.Early versions were proposed
              and demonstrated by author/inventor David L. Heiserman.Some modern
              factory robots are "autonomous" within the strict confines of
              their direct environment. It may not be that every degree of
              freedom exists in their surrounding environment, but the factory
              robot's workplace is challenging and can often contain chaotic,
              unpredicted variables. The exact orientation and position of the
              next object of work and (in the more advanced factories) even the
              type of object and the required task must be determined. This can
              vary unpredictably (at least from the robot's point of view). One
              important area of robotics research is to enable the robot to cope
              with its environment whether this be on land, underwater, in the
              air, underground, or in space. <br />
              A fully autonomous robot can :
              <ul>
                  <li>Gain information about the environment</li>
                  <li>Work for an extended period without human intervention</li>
                  <li>Move either all or part of itself throughout its operating environment without human assistance</li>
                  <li>Avoid situations that are harmful to people, property, or itself unless those are part of its design specifications</li>
              </ul>

            <h1>Autonomous production</h1>
            <p>
                Artificial intelligence (AI) use cases are becoming increasingly powerful and adopting much more of an applied focus in many fields, including process control. And automation has come a long way in recent years. Both of these developments bring the vision of autonomous production within reach for the first time.
            </p>
            <p> Roland Berger is currently conducting a study on autonomous production systems in discrete manufacturing in order to outline the progress that has been made and identify the key drivers of developments. One conceivable scenario is that future production systems will operate fully autonomously – with machines that are able to optimize themselves, communicate with each other and with a higher-level control system that can even make decisions in the event of malfunctions (reflecting Manufacturing Autonomy Level 5 in the diagram), and also improve the overall process. Experts call this lights-out manufacturing. However, it requires extensive automation and connectivity within and between production processes. So, how far away are we from seeing this vision brought to life? And what contribution can we expect from artificial intelligence and the like? What parts of the future vision are already possible in production today and what elements are still missing? These are the questions that our study examines.</p>

            <h1>Self-driving car</h1>
            
            <p> A self-driving car, also known as an autonomous vehicle (AV), connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV), driverless car, robo-car, or robotic car(automated vehicles and fully automated vehicles in the European Union) is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input. <br>
                Self-driving cars combine a variety of sensors to perceive their surroundings, such as radar, lidar, sonar, GPS, odometry and inertial measurement units.Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage <br>
                Connected vehicle platoons and long-distance trucking are seen as being at the forefront of adopting and implementing the technology.
            </p>
            <h2>Tesla</h2>
            <p>Tesla states that Autopilot is "designed to assist drivers with the most burdensome parts of driving" in order to make Tesla cars "safer and more capable over time." Tesla states that current (as of July 2020) Autopilot features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.  <br>
                Starting in September 2014, all Tesla cars are shipped with sensors and software to support Autopilot (initially hardware version 1 or "HW1"). Tesla upgraded its sensors and software in October 2016 ("HW2") to support full self-driving in the future.HW2 includes eight cameras, twelve ultrasonic sensors, and forward-facing radar. HW2.5 was released in mid-2017, and it upgraded HW2 with a second graphics process unit (GPU) and, for the Model 3 only, a driver-facing camera.HW3 was released in early 2019. <br>
                At the end of 2016, Tesla expected to demonstrate full autonomy by the end of 2017,and in April 2017, Musk predicted that in around two years, drivers would be able to sleep in their vehicle while it drives itself.In 2018 Tesla revised the date to demonstrate full autonomy to be by the end of 2019.In January 2020, Musk stated that the full self-driving software would be "feature complete" by the end of 2020, and added that feature complete "doesn't mean that features are working well." <br>
                In April 2019, Tesla announced that all of its cars will include Autopilot software (defined as just Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and Autosteer (Beta)) as a standard feature moving forward.Full self-driving software (Autopark, Navigate on Autopilot (Beta), Auto Lane Change (Beta), Summon (Beta), Smart Summon (Beta) and future abilities) is an extra cost option. 
            </p>
            <p>On April 24, 2020, Tesla released a software update to its full self driving capability. With this update, cars recognize and automatically stop at stop signs. The cars also automatically slow down and eventually stop at traffic lights (even if they are green), and the driver indicates that it is safe to proceed through the traffic light.Tesla acknowledges that the software is still in a beta phase and far from being finished.</p>
            <p>Tesla is planning to release a subscription package for their self-driving software.  On April 28, 2020, a hacker revealed on Twitter that there is already code in Tesla’s app for the subscription plan.</p>
